  <h1> Call BedHeads now: <a href="tel:+14133442337">413-344-BEDS</a> or 413-344-2337.</h1>
  <h2> Keep people alive, off streets, and out of jail, by finding more beds faster. </h2>
  <p>When a hospital runs out of beds, a person either gets denied treatment, may become homeless, or go to jail.</p>

  <p> Hospitals spend 20+ minutes per patient calling around to see available beds <i>and cannot contact all hospitals</i>. No database of beds exists.</p>

  <p>
    <b>BedHeads</b> does this coordination for doctors in the medium they already use -- their analog phone. They do not need to learn to use a computer. They don't need to decide which facilities to call with limited time.</p>

  <p>Caregivers give a pin to identify themselves, and can update their bed count and hear availability of others.</p>

  <p>Patients can use this data to find hospitals with beds, avoiding delays and $180/mile ambulance transfers.</p>

  <h2>Future plans:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Call once a day so they don't forget to update the bedCount.</li>
    <li>Keep track of different types of beds, like Medical &amp; Psychiatry, or youth.</li>
    <li>Use machine learning to predict where beds might free up.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>This data updates live:</h2>
  <div id="beds"></div>
  <script type="text/javascript">
  function updateCount() {
  fetch("https://bedheads-api.herokuapp.com/api/facilities")
    .then(res => res.json())
